# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview
- This project builds a community library discovery service.
- See /product/product-foundation.md for detailed product goals.

## Agents Priority
- When working inside a subdirectory, prioritize and follow that subdirectory's `AGENTS.md` over the root `AGENTS.md`.
- Apply the root `AGENTS.md` as default guidance only when no closer `AGENTS.md` exists.

## PO Skills Routing
- Use `po-story` when the task is to create a user story.
- Use `po-spec` when the task is to evaluate, create, or update a specification.
- Use `po-spec` for specification Q&A about product intent, requirements, acceptance criteria, and constraints.
- For implementation-level questions, keep PO scope boundary clear and escalate to engineering roles.
